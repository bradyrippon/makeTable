# _%tblMaker()_

The SAS macro **_%tblMaker()_** can currently be used to create summary tables in the form of a standard **Table 1** seen in medical journals. This macro automatically detects categorical/continuous variables, calculates appropriate descriptive statistics, reports data missingness, and performs appropriate statistical tests across column groupings.
